You'll also need a config.cfg in the same directory as the cgi script
(use symlinks to keep this out of your cgi-bin). It should look like this:

[Database]
connection=sqlite:///beta.db.sqlite

[Gmail]
username=myusername@gmail.com
password=mygmailpassword

[Site]
scriptURL=http://path/to/actions.py


==WSGI==

Make sure mod_wsgi is installed and loaded by Apache.

In your VirtualHost definition, define a script alias to the actions.py script:

WSGIScriptAlias /mobile/ /path/to/repository/actions.py
